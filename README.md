# Numerical-Methods-for-Differential-Equations
Numerical methods are used to find an approximation to those problems which are very difficult to solve symbolically. Codes are written in Python & MATLAB. For every
algorithm an example has been used as well as a MATLAB live script or/and a jupyter notebook file has been added to each folder to see the results for the example.
