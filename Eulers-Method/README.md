# Euler's Method and Modified Euler's Method

Both of the methods are used to calculate an approximate solution of an Ordinary Differential Equation.

## Problem
Find approximate solution of $y' = y - t^2 + 1$, $y(0) = 0.5$, with $0 \leq t \leq 2$. Exact solution of this differential equation is $y = (t + 1)^2 - \dfrac{e^t}{2}$.

## Key-Notes
- In both of the algorithms, step_size = h = 0.1.
- floating numbers have been rounded to 7 significant digits after the decimal point.
